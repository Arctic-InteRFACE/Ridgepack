# Ridgepack Case: JAMES\_2018\_Variational\_Ridging

This directory contains scripts used to generate figures 3 to 16, S1 and S2 in:

Roberts, A.F., E.C. Hunke, S.M. Kamal, W.H. Lipscomb, C. Horvat, W. Maslowski (2018),
Variational Method for Sea Ice Ridging in Earth System Models, Part I: Theory, *submitted to J. Adv. Model Earth Sy.*.

Scripts are also included used to text the morphology section of the ridging paper.

## Synopsis

ridgepack\_JAMES\_figureX.m    - MATLAB script for figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 
ridgepack\_JAMES\_figure13.nb  - Mathematica notebook used to produce figure 13
ridgepack\_JAMES\_ridgegraph.m - MATLAB script for figures 8, 9, S1, S2
ridgepack\_JAMES\_integrateg.m - MATLAB script for redistribution including figure 16
ridgepack\_grplot.m             - MATLAB script comparing numeric & analytic solutions of gR

## Description

Graphical output from these scripts is written to the adjacent case directory "output" 
to this scripts directory.  LaTex output will appear in this directory unless otherwise 
specified on the command line. Each script includes a commented section explaining the code.
