# Ridgepack Cases

This directory is for cases that use the core MATLAB libraries
of Ridgepack for specific analysis and research papers.  All MATLAB scripts 
within case directories use functions within the adjacent library directory. 
Those functions are documented separately from the scripts that use them in 
this case directory.
