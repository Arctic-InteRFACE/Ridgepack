 This code is published in consonance with the American Geophysical Union publication 
 policy.  Here, we briefly describe the intended use of the functions and scripts within 
 Ridgepack.  Further information on the use of the morphology library within Ridgepack 
 is available in the aforementioned paper, and detailed technical descriptions of all 
 components of the package are available with the use of the 'help' command in MATLAB. 
 
 Code version: 1.0 \
 Code authors: Andrew Roberts and Samy Kamal \
 Code tested with MATLAB version R2018a 

 Embargo: This code is currently held in a private GitHub repository, and will
          be published when and if the above manuscript passes peer review.
